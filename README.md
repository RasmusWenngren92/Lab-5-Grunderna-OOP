Circle and Triangle Calculator

This is a console application written in C# that allows users to calculate various properties of spheres and triangles, such as area, volume, and perimeter. The application is structured around object-oriented principles, as part of a lab assignment for a C# and .NET programming course.

Features
Sphere Calculations:
Calculate the surface area of a sphere.
Calculate the volume of a sphere.
Calculate the perimeter (circumference) of a sphere.
Triangle Calculations:
Calculate the area of a triangle.
Calculate the volume of a triangular prism.
Calculate the perimeter of a triangle.
Installation
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Open the solution in Visual Studio or your preferred C# development environment.
Build the solution to restore dependencies.
Run the program.
Usage
Upon starting the application, you will be presented with a menu:

Option A: Perform calculations related to spheres.
Option B: Perform calculations related to triangles.
Option C: Exit the program.
Sphere Calculations
Input the radius of the sphere to compute the area, volume, or perimeter.
Triangle Calculations
Input the lengths of the three sides of the triangle. The program will use these values to calculate the area, volume, or perimeter.
